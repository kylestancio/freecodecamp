# Cash Register Application

A cash register application for the [free code camp certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-cash-register-project/build-a-cash-register).


## Introduction

This is a free code camp certification project which requires me to create a cash register application. I was able to implement it in an object-oriented approach. The program doesn't accept inputs for price, as well as the cash in drawer.

I have added additional features such as viewing the cash in drawer, as well as displaying the price that was set.
