# Markdown Previewer

This is a [certification project for Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).

## Introduction

Hi! I've created this web application as a certification project for Free Code Camp. This is a website where you can input some markdown text in the textarea and preview it in the a preview pane on the right. A challenge in this project is that I have to think of a way to prevent cross-site scripting, as well as hosting this project.

I have also added some additional features such as testing with cypress.
